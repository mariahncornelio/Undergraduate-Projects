# Undergraduate Projects
This repository contains various projects I have completed during my undergraduate studies. Below is a brief summary of what each project folder includes and the programming languages used.

### Mydlarz Lab Disease Study
This was my first coding project during my time conducting research at the Mydlarz Lab. My PI, Emily Van Buren, assigned me to assist with her chapter project on disease classification in coral host species (Colpophyllia natans, Orbicella faveolata, Orbicella annularis, Pseudodiploria strigosa, Porites astreoides, Siderastrea siderea, and Montastraea cavernosa) and their symbionts. She provided pipelines for machine learning techniques such as SVM, count normalization, presence/absence studies, differential expression analysis, and BBSplit, allowing me to practice and familiarize myself with how different -omics data integrate. The outputs in this folder were generated by me, with R as the primary tool used to produce results.

This project includes code pipelines and outputs for:

BBSplit (R) / Support Vector Machine (SVM) Learning (R) / Presence-Absence Studies (R) / Venn Diagrams for SVM Output (R) / Differential Expression Analysis & Count Normalization (R) / Average Plots (R)

### Mydlarz Lab Melanin Study
Branching off from programming in R, I then learned to use secure shell script (SSH) and primarily work on my terminal using linux/unix commands. I was granted access to UTA's High Performance Computing Clustter (UTA HPC) and used programs such as Hmmer to obtain outputs. All code and files in this folder are created by me and were used in the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382369267_Structural_and_Evolutionary_Relationships_of_Melanin_Cascade_Proteins_in_Cnidarian_Innate_Immunity">melanin study paper</a>. I also worked with Excel and R in this project in order to clean the tabular outputs generated by hmmer so that we could match genes of M. cavernosa to humans in the tyrosinase metabolic pathway.

This project includes code pipelines and outputs for:

Hmmer (HPC Terminal) / Procedure on how to clean tabular outputs (Excel) / How to melt data (R) / Organizing and cleaning melted data (R)

### Python 1 Coral Bleaching Project

### Undergrad Research Opportunity Program (UROP)

### Walsh Lab Killifish Experiments
